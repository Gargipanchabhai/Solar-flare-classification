# Solar Flare Classification

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on the
classification of solar flares. The project is developed as part of an
MSc Data Science semester project.

## Problem Statement
Solar flares are sudden eruptions of energy on the solar surface that
can impact space weather and communication systems. The goal of this
project is to build classification models that can predict the class
of a solar flare based on observed features.

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis on solar flare datasets
- Apply feature engineering techniques
- Train and evaluate machine learning classification models
- Compare model performance using appropriate metrics

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Repository Structure
- `data/` : Dataset files (not tracked in Git)
- `notebooks/` : Jupyter notebooks for EDA and modeling
- `src/` : Source code for preprocessing and models
- `README.md` : Project overview
